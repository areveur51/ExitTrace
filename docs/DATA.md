# Data pack

The committed `data/seed.json` is the portable import. `media/` holds stored portraits and dog-comm stills.

GitHub Releases publish a zip of those two directories. The `/downloads` page describes the zip and does not fetch it.

## Publish

`scripts/pack-data.sh` writes `dist/exittrace-data-YYYYMMDD.zip` and a `.sha256` file. The zip is not committed. The `data-release` workflow attaches that zip to:

- `data-YYYYMMDD`
- `data-latest` (replaced on each publish)

## Fetch

```bash
./scripts/fetch-data.sh
```

That resolves the zip on the `data-latest` release. You can also pass a direct asset URL.
